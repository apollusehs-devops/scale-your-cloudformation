# Conclusion
The information compiled in this guide gives a more thorough understanding on the value of _Infrastructure as Code_ with AWS CloudFormation. Itâ€™s a tool that still hides opportunities to maximise team producvitity. It is not enough to look at it at face-value and not ponder at the many different ways that it can be leveraged. Infrastrucure as code, just like source code, has aspects that can be automated; templates, simple snippets, security scans or even architecture diagrams. They can and should be delegated to software while we focus on higher value tasks.
